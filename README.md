# Dance-Insider
This is the repository for the project called Dance Insider. 

The echoAR application is not working with Unity. Although plane tracking was working, image tracking along with video rendering wasn't working.
Inside of the echoAR console, a demo of the Dance Museum was shown. 
Inside of the dance museum, there are nameplates for every dance form, and if we hover our phone's camera over it, we'll be able to see the hand-picked videos.

There was an issue with that as well. The video wasn't rendering. 

1. A basic prototype of the android application was made to show the flow of the application. 
2. There are two buttons in the android application for the AR based awareness hacks. 
3. One is for the types of makeup used for different types of dances. (For this, SparkAR and Photoshop were used)
The second one is for the Dance Museum so that people are aware of the different dance forms. (For this, EchoAR console and Unity were used)
